#include<string>
using namespace std;
 
int WordCounter(string s)
{
  //Initialize the counter
  int counter = 0;
   
    // Store independent words
    string w;
   
    // Breake words
    stringstream x(s);
 
    // counting words
    while (x >> w)
        counter++;
    return counter;
}
 

int main()
{
    string sample = "Sample code from me0wiss";
    cout << " Word Count: " << WordCounter(sample);
    return 0;
}
```

```
 Word Count : 4

**another example**

```cpp
stringstream ss("15,44,46");
